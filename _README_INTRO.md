# Backbone.Giraffe

## Introduction

[__Backbone.Giraffe__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe)
is a light and flexible library that extends
[__Backbone.js__](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) to new heights.
__Giraffe__'s goal is to follow the __Backbone__ philosophy
to provide commonly needed features with few assumptions. It differs
from other __Backbone__ libraries like __Marionette__ and __Chaplin__ in its
reduced scope and size, and it takes a different approach to the problems of
route handling, object lifecycles, event aggregation, and view management.

## Overview

- __Giraffe.View__ is a nestable and flexible class that provides lifecycle
management and many other useful features. It defaults to __Underscore__
templates and easily supports any form of templating.

- __Giraffe.App__ is a special view that helps your views, models, collections,
and routers communicate by acting as an event hub. Multiple apps can coexist and
teardown is as simple as it gets.

- __Giraffe.Router__ leverages an app's events to trigger routing events that
any object can listen for. It also has reverse routes to allow the construction
of URLs using app events and arguments.

- __Giraffe.Model__ and __Giraffe.Collection__ are thin wrappers that add
__Giraffe__'s lifecycle management and app events. Any object can mix
in this functionality via `Giraffe.configure`.

check out our [__live examples__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/viewBasics.html).

## How Giraffe is Different

__Giraffe__ was created by the needs of our team as we built
[__Barc__](http://barc.com). We tried many existing libraries but some did way too
much, others added too many layers, and others performed poorly.

__Giraffe__ does not have all the bells and whistles of the larger frameworks.
We found the effort to customize them for our needs was more effort than simply
building upon __Backbone__ with a minimalist approach. For example, there is no
concept of specialized containers like regions or layouts, as any view in
__Giraffe__ can act as a parent of one or more child views. __Giraffe__ also
has no CollectionView or ItemView
(see [__Giraffe.Contrib.CollectionView__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/collectionView.html)
and [__Giraffe.Contrib.FastCollectionView__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/fastCollectionView.html)),
but we are open to suggestions to make __Giraffe__ as useful as possible to
__Backbone__ developers who want an extension library with few opinions.

Is this framework for you? It depends. We feel __Giraffe__ adds essential
features to make you more productive with __Backbone__.

### Highlights

- [__Routes emit events__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/routersAndAppEvents.html)
instead of being tied to functions. This makes it extremely simple for a deeply
nested view to act on a route.

- [__Reverse routes with arguments__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/backbone.giraffe.html#Router)
provide a way to trigger routes in the application using app events without
having to know a URL path.

- [__Giraffe.App__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/appEvents.html) is a
special view that acts as an event hub to help your app communicate and respond
to routes, and all __Giraffe__ objects have convenient `appEvents` bindings
inspired by `Backbone.View#events`.

- [__`Giraffe.View#attachTo(someElement)`__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/backbone.giraffe.html#View-attachTo)
allows views to move anywhere on the DOM without clobbering each other's events,
and it automatically sets up parent-child relationships for memory management.

- [__Lifecycle management__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/lifecycleManagement.html)
mitigates memory leaks. It's automatic for nested views and can be used for any
object with a `dispose` method via `Giraffe.View#addChild`.

- [__(A)sync app initialization__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/appInitialization.html)
helps an app reach its ready state. For example, an app may need to wait for
asynchronous bootstrap data or a websocket connection before starting.

- [__Declarative event handling__](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/documentEvents.html)
in markup provides simple one-way binding. (does not try to be __Knockout__ or
__AngularJS__)

- [__Optional Giraffe.Contrib__](https://github.com/barc/backbone.giraffe/blob/master/src/backbone.giraffe.contrib.coffee)
extensions include a simple Controller class with __Giraffe__'s lifecycle and `appEvents` features,
a [CollectionView](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/collectionView.html)
that renders a collection with a view per model,
and a [FastCollectionView](http://ryanatkn.github.io/backbone.giraffe/fastCollectionView.html)
that renders a collection with a single view
[more efficiently than Giraffe.Contrib.CollectionView and Marionette.CollectionView](http://jsperf.com/collection-views-in-giraffe-and-marionette/5).
